# Abilities and Skills

## Advancement

### No converting tests

You cannot simply convert successful tests into skill advancement. Tests must be earned through meaningful challenges and character development.

### Clean the slate

At the start of each session, mark any tests you've earned from the previous session's goals, beliefs, and conflicts.

### Conflicts earn one test

Participating in a full conflict (regardless of outcome) earns you one test toward a skill used in that conflict.

### Disposition roll

The final disposition roll in a conflict counts as a test for advancement if you participated meaningfully.

### Ties and advancement

Tied conflicts still count for advancement - the struggle itself teaches you something.

### Obstacle 0 tests

Trivial tests (obstacle 0) don't count for advancement. There must be real risk of failure for learning to occur.

## Learning a new skill

To learn a completely new skill, you must find a teacher, training materials, or gain practical experience. This typically requires spending Persona points and narrative justification.

## Will

Will represents mental fortitude, determination, and force of personality.

### Will obstacles

Will tests cover:
- Resisting fear, intimidation, or mental influence
- Maintaining composure under pressure
- Leading others in crisis situations
- Persevering through hardship or despair
- Social situations requiring force of personality

Will is also used to determine starting disposition in social conflicts and contributes to recovery from mental conditions like Stressed or Angry.

## Health

Health represents physical fitness, constitution, and bodily resilience.

### Health obstacles

Health tests cover:
- Resisting disease, poison, or environmental hazards
- Enduring physical hardship or exertion
- Recovering from injuries or conditions
- Surviving in hostile environments
- Maintaining peak physical performance

Health is used to determine starting disposition in physical conflicts and affects recovery speed from physical conditions like Injured, Sick, or Tired.

## Circles

Circles represents your network of contacts, allies, and connections across known space.

### Home planet advantage

When operating on your home planet or in familiar territory, gain +1 die to Circles tests due to established relationships and local knowledge.

### Circles factors

Circles difficulty varies by location:
- **Home system**: Obstacle 2-3
- **Familiar regions**: Obstacle 3-4  
- **Neutral space**: Obstacle 4-5
- **Hostile territory**: Obstacle 5-6
- **Unexplored regions**: Obstacle 6+

### Circles success

Successful Circles tests introduce helpful NPCs, provide information, or grant access to resources. The margin of success determines how useful or well-disposed the contact is.

### Circles twist -- the enmity clause

Failed Circles tests don't just mean no help - they can introduce enemies, rivals, or complications from your past. That contact you were hoping to find might hold a grudge.

### Enemies to friends, friends to enemies

Relationships evolve through play. Allies can become rivals through your actions, and enemies might become valuable contacts if you find common ground.

## Resources

Resources represents your access to credits, connections, and material wealth across known space. Whether through personal fortune, corporate backing, or resourceful networking, your Resources rating determines what you can acquire on short notice.

Resources ratings range from 1 to 10, representing everything from a struggling drifter to a sector-spanning merchant prince.

### Home system advantage

You get +1 die when using Resources in your home system, where your reputation, connections, and established credit lines provide better access to goods and services.

### Common Resources obstacles

Test Resources to acquire equipment, services, or passage. The galactic economy runs on Imperial credits, but favors, information, and reputation can be just as valuable as hard currency.

**Starport basics:**
- Station meal or drinks, Ob 1
- Hostel bunk for the night, Ob 2  
- Standard clothing or personal items, Ob 2
- Basic tools or equipment, Ob 3
- Quality starport lodging, Ob 3

**Equipment and weapons:**
- Simple melee weapons (blade, club), Ob 3
- Basic protective gear (cloth armor, vacc suit patches), Ob 3
- Advanced weapons (laser pistol, accelerator rifle), Ob 4
- Military-grade armor or equipment, Ob 4
- Restricted or military hardware, Ob 5+

**Transportation:**
- Low passage ticket, Ob 3
- Middle passage ticket, Ob 4
- High passage luxury travel, Ob 5
- Charter a small craft, Ob 5
- Purchase used starship components, Ob 6+

**Information and services:**
- Local information or minor favors, Ob 2
- Professional services (legal, medical), Ob 3
- Specialized expertise or rare data, Ob 4
- Corporate or government access, Ob 5+

### Resources factors

For items not listed above, combine these factors to determine obstacle:

**Availability:** Common (+1), Uncommon (+2), Rare (+3), Restricted (+4)
**Quality:** Basic (+1), Professional (+2), Military-grade (+3), Cutting-edge (+4)
**Quantity:** Single item (0), Multiple (+1), Bulk order (+2)
**Legality:** Legal (0), Questionable (+1), Illegal (+2), Highly restricted (+3)

A character wanting to buy a personal grav vehicle might face: Uncommon (+2) + Professional (+2) = Ob 4.

### Cash flow crisis

Failed Resources tests can result in standard conditions (Angry, Tired) or the special depletion condition. When depleted, reduce Resources by 1 - representing overextended credit, frozen accounts, or burned connections.

You still get what you were seeking, but at significant cost to your financial standing. Depleted Resources can be advanced normally through successful tests and character development.
