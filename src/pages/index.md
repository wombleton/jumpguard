## Overview

Jump Guard adapts the Mouse Guard RPG system for spacefaring adventures in the Mongoose Traveller universe. Players take on the roles of a starship crew navigating the dangers of space, trade, and interstellar politics.

### How it's different to Mongoose Traveller

While Mongoose Traveller focuses on detailed simulation and skill-based resolution, Jump Guard emphasizes narrative drama and collaborative storytelling. The game uses a structured turn-based approach with Space Turns for missions and Ship Turns for character development and crew interactions.

### Base game

You'll need the Mouse Guard system to answer detailed questions on play.

### Unplanned stories

Jump Guard thrives on emergent narrative. The GM sets up situations, but the crew's decisions and dice results determine how events unfold. When the mission is over, whether it's a success or failure, we get to look back and see the story that we've created.

### Dice rolls, successes and failures

Jump Guard uses d6 dice pools. A 4+ is a success, and anything else is a failure.
