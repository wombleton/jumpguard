# The Ship

Your ship is more than transportation &mdash; it's home, livelihood, and survival all at once. But ships require constant attention across three critical areas: Debt, Maintenance, and Supplies. Neglect any of these and your ship will suffer. Keep all three current and your ship operates at peak efficiency.

## The Three Tracks

Every ship has three condition tracks representing ongoing pressures that require regular attention:

### Debt
The mortgage, loans, and financial obligations that keep creditors at bay. Most crews operate on borrowed credits and deferred payments.

### Maintenance  
The endless technical work needed to keep systems operational. Ships break down without constant care and replacement parts.

### Supplies
The consumables and supplies that keep the ship operational: food, water, air, fuel, spare parts, ammunition, and other essential provisions.

## Track Conditions

Each track has four levels that worsen without attention:

- **Current**: Everything is up to date and functioning properly
- **Behind**: Starting to slip but still manageable  
- **In Trouble**: In serious decline, +1 Ob to track maintenance tests.
- **Critical**: Consequences and +1 Ob to all track tests.

Usually, all three tracks start at **Current** when you acquire a new ship, with three checkboxes in each level.

### Debt
| Current | Behind | In Trouble | Critical |
|-|-|-|-|
| ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ | ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ | ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ | ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ |

### Maintenance
| Current | Behind | In Trouble | Critical |
|-|-|-|-|
| ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ | ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ | ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ | ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ |

### Supplies
| Current | Behind | In Trouble | Critical |
|-|-|-|-|
| ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ | ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ | ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ | ⬜ ⬜ ⬜ |

## The Ship Shape Condition

When all three tracks are **Current**, your ship gains the **Ship Shape** condition:

> **Ship Shape**: Add +1D to all tests related to ship operations, including piloting, gunnery, engineering, sensor operations, and any skill tests that involve using ship equipment or systems.

This represents a crew and vessel operating in perfect harmony—every system maintained, every debt current, morale high, and everything running smoothly.

## Maintaining the Tracks

During each **Ship Turn**, crews must invest actions to maintain their ship or risk degradation:

### Investment Actions
Spend Ship Turn actions on these activities to maintain or recover track levels:

#### Debt Service

To stay at the level you are, one of the crew must spend a check on a successful track maintenance test that helps generate money. Admin, Broker, or Professional skills are good candidates for this test. Say what you are doing to keep ahead of the debt. If the test is failed, or not attempted, check one of the boxes under the current level. If you fill the last one, you drop a level. This test is Ob2 at Current, and is Ob3 at _In Trouble_ or _Critical_.

To improve a level, you must have spent a successful check on track maintenance this Ship Turn, and then spend a second check. It must be a different skill to the track maintenance This test is Ob3 except if you're at _Critical_, when it's Ob4.

#### Ship maintenance

Tests for ship maintenance are Mechanics, Engineering, or Computing. Otherwise they are the same as Debt Service.

#### Supply status

Tests for supplies are Steward, Streetwise, Persuade, Resources.

### Critical status

At a full Critical track, the GM will introduce something to do with that track. It should be a serious problem from letting it slide that much.

#### Recovering from Critical

Rather than improve through the levels, the crew can take one a trait for the ship, clear all checkmarks to go back to _Current_ and fill one of the checkboxes. This makes the track faster to progress in the future, and adds character to the ship -- think the trait _Flagged_ to clear the Debt track, it's a reason to play people being more suspicious of the ship in the future.

## GM Notes

The ship tracks create ongoing pressure that forces crews to balance exploration and adventure with practical concerns. Don't let players ignore these tracks—the consequences should be real and immediate when they reach Critical levels.

Use failed maintenance attempts to introduce complications: that Engineering test failure might mean the life support is acting up, creating a ticking clock for the next adventure. A failed Supply Status attempt might mean contaminated water reserves or dwindling fuel that forces tough choices.

The Ship Shape condition should feel valuable and worth pursuing, but not so essential that losing it cripples the crew. It's a reward for good management, not a punishment for focusing on adventure.
