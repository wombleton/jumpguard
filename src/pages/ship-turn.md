# Ship Turn

The Ship Turn is the crew-focused phase where players pursue personal goals, recover from conditions, and develop character relationships.

## Checks and tests

During Ship Turn, players can make tests to pursue personal objectives, recover from conditions, or develop skills. Each player typically gets one or more actions based on their condition level and available time.

## Recover, regroup, reequip

Use Ship Turn time to heal injuries, reduce stress, repair equipment, and restock supplies. Characters can also research upcoming missions, make contacts, or gather information for future adventures.

## Picking fights amongst the crew

Ship Turn is prime time for interpersonal drama. Characters might argue about decisions made during the Space Turn, compete for resources, or clash over fundamental beliefs. These conflicts should feel organic and drive character development.

## Failure in the Ship Turn

Failed tests during Ship Turn don't end the phase but create complications or relationship tensions. A failed attempt to repair equipment might require expensive parts. A failed social roll might worsen crew dynamics.

## GM role in the Ship Turn

Take a back seat and let players drive their own scenes. Respond to their actions, play NPCs they interact with, and set difficulty numbers for their tests. Look for opportunities to tie their activities back to the larger story.

## Other players' roles during Ship Turn

When not actively pursuing their own goals, players can assist others, roleplay crew interactions, or prepare for the next Space Turn. Everyone should stay engaged even when not in the spotlight.

## End of the Session

### Rewards for Goals, Beliefs, Instincts

At session end, review each character's performance:

- **Goals**: If you achieved a personal goal, mark a test toward advancing a skill used in pursuit of that goal. Set a new goal for next session.
- **Beliefs**: If you acted on a belief in a way that complicated your life or created drama, earn a Fate point. If a belief was challenged or proven wrong, you may rewrite it.
- **Instincts**: If an instinct helped you or got you in trouble, mark it as "activated." Activated instincts can be rewritten between sessions if desired.

Additionally, the GM may award extra Fate or Persona points for exceptional roleplay, clever solutions, or dramatic moments that enhanced the story for everyone.

## Missing a Session

When a player can't attend, their character doesn't simply vanish. Instead:

### During Space Turn
Missing characters are assumed to be handling essential but off-screen duties: monitoring ship systems, maintaining equipment, or gathering information. They don't participate in tests or conflicts but aren't absent from the story.

### During Ship Turn
Missing characters are pursuing their own recovery and personal projects. They automatically succeed at one recovery test and make progress toward their goals, but don't participate in crew interactions.

### Returning Players
When players return, briefly narrate what their character accomplished while away and how they rejoin the active crew. Missing players shouldn't be penalized, but they also shouldn't receive the same advancement opportunities as active participants.
