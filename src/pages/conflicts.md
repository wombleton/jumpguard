# Conflicts

Extended dramatic scenes where characters pursue opposing goals through multiple rounds of actions and reactions.

## Conflict checklist

1. Establish what each side wants to achieve
2. Determine conflict type and appropriate skills
3. Set starting disposition for each side
4. Apply relevant modifiers
5. Choose actions simultaneously each round
6. Resolve actions and reduce disposition
7. Continue until one side reaches zero disposition
8. Apply results based on winner and final disposition

#### Space battle

Fleet engagements, orbital bombardments, or coordinating multi-ship operations against pirates or enemy forces. Skills: Tactics, Gunner, Leadership, Electronics.

#### Other

Hacking competitions between ship AIs, scientific research races to discover new technologies, or any extended contest can become a conflict.

### Participants

Conflicts typically involve multiple crew members working together toward a common goal. Organize participants into teams using these guidelines:

**Team Sizes:**
- **1-2 crew members**: Always one team
- **3 crew members**: One team (optimal size for coordinated actions)
- **4 crew members**: Two teams of two, or one team of three with one independent operator
- **5 crew members**: Split into teams of three and two

**Maximum team size**: Four crew members per team (not recommended). Larger groups must split into multiple teams for effective coordination.

**Example**: *The pilot, engineer, and gunner can operate as one team during a space battle, or split into two teams—pilot and engineer coordinating ship operations while the gunner operates independently.*

**Opposition teams**: GM characters form teams to oppose the player crews, following the same size guidelines.

**Solo operations**: In one-on-one conflicts, each participant forms their own team and handles all three actions personally.

#### Complement Each Other's Strengths

There are many ways to organize teams - by department, experience level, or personal preference. The captain can assign teams, or crew members can volunteer based on relationships. However, think strategically about team composition. Create balanced teams rather than concentrating all specialists on one side.

Distribute key skills across teams so each has relevant expertise for the conflict type. Don't put all your technical specialists on one team while leaving the other without engineering support.

**Examples:**
- **Negotiation conflict**: If you have two crew members with Broker skill, put them on separate teams so both sides can handle trade discussions effectively.
- **Space battle**: With two gunners and two pilots, form teams pairing each gunner with a pilot for coordinated fire and maneuver tactics.

#### The GM's Opposition

The GM typically organizes opposing forces into teams to challenge the players. Players may sometimes join the GM's side if the situation warrants it (corporate politics, divided loyalties, etc.).

When possible, the GM should field a number of teams equal to the players' teams for balanced opposition. If fewer NPCs are available, the GM compensates by playing more aggressively or using environmental advantages.

**Allied NPCs**: GM characters sympathetic to the crew can provide help using teamwork rules, but cannot take actions directly for the players in conflicts.

**Example**: *A Traveller's Aid Society representative mediates a dispute between the crew and port authorities. The TAS rep supports the crew's position and can provide helping dice from their Advocate skill, but cannot take actions in the argument conflict.*

**Player defection**: Players may join GM teams when circumstances demand it (court-martial proceedings, corporate betrayal, etc.). They help and choose actions normally for their adopted side.

#### Staying Neutral

If your character has no stake in a particular conflict, it's perfectly acceptable to remain neutral. Take a moment to appreciate the tactical decisions and roleplay from the sidelines.

Sometimes crew members are physically separated or have conflicting duties that prevent participation. The engineer might be maintaining life support during a diplomatic crisis, or the medic might be treating patients while the rest of the crew handles a security situation.

Neutral characters can:
- Observe and provide commentary
- Offer help to either side (but must choose before helping)
- Prepare for consequences of the conflict's outcome
- Handle other shipboard duties while the conflict unfolds

Your character will have their moment to shine in future conflicts.

## Conflict goals

Each side must have a clear, achievable goal that defines what victory means. Goals should be mutually exclusive or create meaningful opposition.

Each team declares a specific objective they want to accomplish through this conflict. Conflict goals are similar to session objectives but focused on immediate outcomes. Include a clear statement about what you want to achieve, how you'll do it, and who or what you're targeting.

**Example**: *The crew's ship is interdicted by system patrol vessels. The crew's goal: "Escape to hyperspace before the patrol can board and discover our illegal cargo." The patrol's goal: "Board and search the merchant vessel to verify their cargo manifest."*

**Common goal templates:**
- **Convince/Persuade**: Change minds, gain support, negotiate terms
- **Escape/Evade**: Break free, avoid capture, reach safety  
- **Capture/Secure**: Take prisoners, seize objectives, control territory
- **Disable/Neutralize**: Stop threats without destruction, render inoperable
- **Defend/Protect**: Hold positions, shield allies, prevent access
- **Survive/Endure**: Weather attacks, outlast opponents, minimize losses

Be creative with your goals, but ensure they're specific enough that everyone understands what victory looks like.

#### Matching Goals to Conflict Types

Goals must align with the conflict type being used. You can't use an argument conflict to physically harm opponents - that requires a fight conflict. Similarly, you can't use combat to change someone's mind - that needs an argument or speech conflict.

**Examples of goal/conflict alignment:**
- **Fight conflict**: "Disable the pirates," "Breach the airlock," "Defend the bridge"
- **Argument conflict**: "Convince the captain to change course," "Prove our innocence"
- **Space battle**: "Destroy the enemy escort," "Escape to hyperspace," "Capture the flagship"
- **Negotiation**: "Secure favorable trade terms," "Gain salvage rights"

Record your conflict goal where you track session objectives, ensuring all team members understand what victory looks like.
#### When Are Lives at Stake?

In fights, space battles, and dangerous journeys, it is possible to use lethal force as a goal, but this requires specific circumstances and group consent. 

Lethal goals are appropriate when:
- Characters face genuinely mortal threats (pirates, hostile aliens, environmental disasters)
- Non-lethal solutions have been exhausted or are impossible
- The stakes justify extreme measures
- All players consent to potentially lethal consequences

Most conflicts should focus on achieving objectives rather than eliminating opponents. Capture, disable, or drive off enemies rather than killing them when possible. See Consequences and Death later in this chapter for detailed guidelines.

## Starting disposition

Each side begins with disposition equal to their Will + relevant skill. This represents their ability to continue fighting for their goal.

## Modifiers to disposition

Circumstances, preparation, equipment, or environmental factors can modify starting disposition up or down by 1-3 points.

**Environmental factors:**
- Superior position (high ground, defensive systems): +1 to +2
- Hostile environment (vacuum, radiation, gravity): -1 to -2
- Familiar territory (home system, known station): +1

**Equipment advantages:**
- Better weapons or armor: +1 to +2
- Advanced ship systems or technology: +1 to +3
- Adequate supplies vs. shortage: +1 vs. -1

**Preparation:**
- Intelligence gathering or reconnaissance: +1
- Surprise or ambush: +2
- Time to plan and coordinate: +1

**Conditions:**
Check your character's conditions for disposition effects. Stressed, Angry, and Tired each reduce disposition by 1 in applicable conflicts.

## Actions

Conflicts play out through a structured sequence of tactical decisions. Each side chooses three actions in advance from: Attack, Defend, Feint, Maneuver. Each action has different effects and interacts with opposing actions in specific ways.

Actions are chosen in sets of three, then revealed one at a time. Once everyone's actions are revealed, roleplay the interaction and make tests.

**Process:**
1. Each side privately chooses three actions (1, 2, 3) and records them secretly
2. The team leader typically makes these tactical decisions for their side
3. GM announces "Action 1" and reveals their first action  
4. All sides reveal their first actions simultaneously
5. Resolve according to action descriptions and interaction chart
6. Repeat for Actions 2 and 3

**Example:**
*The crew chooses: Maneuver, Attack, Defend*
*The pirates choose: Attack, Attack, Feint*

Describe how your characters execute each action within the conflict's context, then roll dice to determine results.

### Action Abstraction
The four actions—Attack, Defend, Feint and
Maneuver—are abstract, so you can apply
them to nearly any type of conflict. During
play, you get to interpret them and make them
fit the situation in your game. Their rules stay
the same, but how you describe them and what
they mean in the game world is different for
each conflict. You’ll have to negotiate with each
other a bit to figure out which descriptions fit
and which don’t. Table chatter is an important
part of this process. Once everyone is taking
turns describing their actions, you’ll get into
the rhythm of it.

The four actions are described in terms of
obstacle, how they interact with the other actions
and how to describe them in a conflict.

#### Attack

The Attack action represents direct aggressive action toward your goal. In a fight, this means firing weapons or engaging in close combat. In an argument, this means making a strong, direct point. In a chase, it means pushing engines to maximum thrust. In a negotiation, an Attack exposes your opponent's weaknesses. In a space battle, an Attack damages enemy ships or captures strategic objectives. On a journey, an Attack means pushing forward regardless of hazards.

Attack played against Attack or Feint is an independent test. When played against Defend or Maneuver, it is a versus test. Attack reduces your opponent's disposition by the margin of success.

**Independent Obstacle:** 0. Successes from an independent Attack are subtracted from your opponent's disposition.

#### Defend

The Defend action protects and strengthens your position. In a fight, this means raising shields or taking cover. In an argument, it represents an excellent rebuttal. In a chase, a Defend action means plotting safe courses or using countermeasures. In a negotiation, a Defend emphasizes the strengths of your position. In a space battle, use Defend to regroup, reinforce shields, or coordinate defensive formations. On a journey, Defend represents careful navigation and system checks.

Defend played against Attack or Maneuver is a versus test. When played against another Defend, the actions are independent. When played against a Feint, Defend may not test. Feint beats it.

Defend stops or reduces the effectiveness of Attack and Maneuver actions. If Defend successes are greater than the versus action, add the margin of success to your disposition. Disposition cannot go higher than the starting total.

**Independent Obstacle:** 3. For independent Defends, the margin of success is added to your disposition. Disposition cannot go higher than the starting total. If you don't get more than three successes, nothing happens.

#### Feint

A Feint represents deception and misdirection. It's dangerous to attempt but very effective when successful. In a fight, a Feint means false targeting or sensor jamming. In an argument, it's a misleading point used to trap your opponent. In a chase, it's a sudden vector change or false transponder signal. In negotiation, it's temporary agreement to set up a reversal. In a space battle, Feint uses decoys or false sensor readings to draw enemy fire away from your real attack. On a journey, a Feint represents taking calculated shortcuts through dangerous space.

Feint is a special attack. If played against Defend, the Defender may not test. The Feinter makes an independent test; your target's disposition is reduced by your margin of success. If played against an Attack, the Feinting player may not attack or defend. If played against another Feint, make a versus test. The margin of success is subtracted from the loser's disposition. If played against Maneuver, test Feint at Ob 0. Successes are removed from your opponent's disposition.

**Independent Obstacle:** 0. Successes from an independent Feint are subtracted from your opponent's disposition.

#### Maneuver

The Maneuver action gains tactical advantage over your opponent. In a fight, a Maneuver means flanking movements or tactical positioning. In an argument, it's complex rhetoric that confuses the issue. In a chase, a Maneuver uses environmental features or dirty tricks. In negotiation, a Maneuver reveals new information or surprising contract terms. In a space battle, Maneuver positions ships for optimal firing angles or uses stellar phenomena tactically. On a journey, the action represents course plotting, resource management, or environmental adaptation.

The Maneuver action creates temporary advantages. It's the most complex of the four actions, with three possible effects: impede, gain position, and disarm. Each effect requires a specific margin of success. You can't use the same effect twice on the same action, but you can use an effect again with subsequent successful Maneuvers.

Played against Attack or Defend, Maneuver is a versus test. Played against Feint or another Maneuver, the Maneuver action is tested independently. Margin of success is applied to the effects below.

**Independent Obstacle:** 0

**Margin of Success 1: Impede** - -1D disadvantage to your opponent's next action. If there are multiple characters on the opposing team, the impede penalty applies to whoever makes the test for the next action. If action interactions mean they don't test, this effect is lost.

**Margin of Success 2: Gain Position** - +2D advantage to your next action. If there are multiple characters on your team, this bonus applies to whoever makes the test for the next action. If action interactions mean you don't test, this bonus is lost.

**Margin of Success 3: Disarm** - Remove one weapon, piece of gear, or disable a trait for the remainder of the conflict. If disarmed and you want to switch equipment, you may do so when you next choose actions. Alternatively, if you win by a margin of success of 3, you may choose both impede and gain position effects.

#### Action Table

Reference this table after actions are announced to determine whether you need to make an independent test or a versus test for your action.

| Your Action | vs Attack | vs Defend | vs Feint | vs Maneuver |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Attack**  | ⚡        | ⚔️        | ⭐       | ⚔️          |
| **Defend**  | ⚔️        | ⚡        | ⭐       | ⚔️          |
| **Feint**   | ⭐        | ⭐        | ⚔️       | ⚡          |
| **Maneuver**| ⚔️        | ⚔️        | ⚡       | ⚡          |

**⚡** = Independent test. Test both actions separately; both actions can succeed or fail.

**⚔️** = Versus test. Roll skills or abilities against each other. Highest successes wins.

**⭐** = Special. Feint is a special attack. If played against Defend, the Defender may not test. The Feinter makes an independent test; successes reduce the target's disposition. If played against an Attack, the Feinting player may not attack or defend.

### Which Skill Do I Use?

Each conflict type allows multiple skill approaches for different actions. Choose skills appropriate to your character's strengths and the specific circumstances.

#### Argument
**Attack/Defend:** Persuade, Advocate, Diplomat  
**Feint/Maneuver:** Deception, Persuade, Art (rhetoric)

#### Chase
**Attack/Maneuver:** Pilot, Flyer, Drive, Athletics  
**Defend/Feint:** Pilot, Electronics (countermeasures), Stealth, Recon

#### Fight
**Attack/Feint:** Gun Combat, Melee, Heavy Weapons, Explosives  
**Defend/Maneuver:** Gun Combat, Melee, Athletics, Tactics, Stealth

Combat allows the widest range of skills - use whatever weapons and tactics your character specializes in.

#### Negotiation
**Attack/Defend:** Broker, Diplomat, Admin, Advocate  
**Feint/Maneuver:** Deception, Broker, Streetwise, Investigate

#### Journey
**Attack/Feint:** Pilot, Astrogation, Engineer  
**Defend/Maneuver:** Pilot, Engineer, Electronics, Survival, Vacc Suit

Environmental hazards (radiation storms, gravity wells, system authorities) serve as the opposition, using GM-determined ratings for their actions.

#### Speech
**Attack/Defend:** Advocate, Art, Leadership, Diplomat  
**Feint/Maneuver:** Deception, Art, Persuade, Language

#### Space Combat
**Attack:** Gunner, Tactics, Pilot (for ramming), Heavy Weapons  
**Defend:** Gunner (point defense), Pilot (evasion), Engineer (damage control), Electronics (jamming)  
**Feint/Maneuver:** Tactics, Electronics (sensor warfare), Pilot (positioning), Leadership (coordination)

#### Other

The conflict system works for any competitive situation in the galaxy. Technical competitions, research races, hacking duels, or emergency repairs can all become conflicts.

When creating custom conflicts, assign appropriate skills to each action type:

**Examples:**
- **Hacking Duel:** Electronics (Computers) for Attack/Defend, Investigate and Deception for Feint/Maneuver
- **Research Race:** Science for Attack/Feint, Investigate and Admin for Defend/Maneuver  
- **Emergency Repairs:** Engineer and Mechanic for Attack/Defend, Electronics and Jack-of-all-Trades for Feint/Maneuver
- **Cargo Loading Contest:** Mechanic for Attack/Defend, Athletics and Steward for Feint/Maneuver

The opposition (rival hackers, time pressure, equipment failures) uses GM-determined ratings for their actions, typically ranging from 3-8 depending on difficulty.

## Multiple Characters in a Team

When multiple crew members work together, each player takes turns testing for and describing their actions. Two players alternate back and forth. Three players each handle one action from the set of three. With four players, the fourth player starts the next exchange of actions.

Players can reorganize their action order each round, but no single player can take consecutive actions. With three players on a team, each gets exactly one action per exchange.

> **Example:** When the pilot and engineer coordinate during a space chase, they alternate actions. The pilot handles action 1 (evasive maneuvers), the engineer takes action 2 (power redistribution), then the pilot takes action 3 (escape vector). In the next exchange, the engineer goes first.

### Team Coordination

Plan tactics around your crew's strengths. Check each team member's skills before assigning actions - ensure whoever takes the test can actually contribute meaningfully. If they can't perform the action effectively, they're still committed to it.

Designate who leads each action and makes the test before the GM reveals their action. Other team members can provide help using their relevant skills and equipment.

### Team Commitment

**Joining a team:** If you help with the initial disposition roll, you're committed to that team for the entire conflict and bound by all results.

**Staying neutral:** If you don't help with disposition, you remain independent and can assist any character on any action, regardless of which side they're on. This flexibility comes at the cost of not being fully integrated into either team's strategy.

## Winning a conflict

Victory goes to the side that reduces their opponents' disposition to zero while maintaining positive disposition themselves.

## Losing a conflict

Defeat means failing to achieve your conflict goal and potentially suffering additional consequences based on how badly you lost.

## Tying a conflict

If all sides reach zero disposition simultaneously, the result is a draw with partial success for everyone or a pyrrhic victory.

## Compromise

At any point, sides can negotiate a compromise that gives everyone something but not everything they wanted.

## Binding results

Conflict results are final and meaningful. Winners achieve their stated goals, and losers must accept the consequences.

## Pass and fail in conflicts

Individual actions within conflicts can succeed or fail, affecting disposition damage and tactical position.
