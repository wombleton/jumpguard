# Conditions

Conditions represent temporary impairments that affect character performance and drive narrative consequences.

## Healthy

The default state. No penalties to tests or conflicts. Characters operate at full effectiveness.

## Stressed

Mental strain from pressure, fear, or overwhelming situations. 

> Any of the crew being Stressed subtracts 1 from all conflict disposition.

## Angry

Emotional volatility from frustration, betrayal, or injustice. 

> Any of the crew being Angry subtracts 1 from a conflict that uses Will as its base.

## Tired

Physical or mental exhaustion from overexertion or lack of rest.

> Any of the crew being Tired subtracts 1 from all conflict disposition.

## Injured

Physical harm from combat, accidents, or environmental dangers.

> Being Injured subtracts -1D from Will, Health, and skill tests. It does not affect Circles or condition recovery rolls.

## Sick

Illness, poisoning, or disease.

> Being Sick subtracts -1D from Will, Health, and skill tests. It does not affect Circles or condition recovery rolls.

## Rating zero

If your ability in any test is reduced to zero from being Injured or Sick, you cannot test it. You cannot benefit from teamwork or help.

## Multiple conditions

Conditions stack - each one imposes its penalty separately. Multiple conditions can quickly incapacitate a character.

## Conditions of failure

- Stressed can be the result of any test.
- Social tests can result in Angry.
- Athletic tests can result in Tired, or Injured.
- Work on ships can result in Angry, or Tired.
- Academic work can result in Tired.

## Conditions in conflicts

Roll disposition and then apply the penalties from conditions. Stressed, Angry, and Tired will do this. Apply the unique conditions in a team.

Injured & Sick affect almost all rolls from the crewmembers.

## Conditions as part of compromise

You can apply conditions as part of a compromise, or even multiple conditions for major compromises.

## Recovery

### Recovery order

Recovery tests must be made in specific order: Stressed first, then Angry, then Tired, then Injured, then Sick. You cannot recover from later conditions while earlier ones remain.

### Stressed

You just need a break! Test one of these skills at Obstacle 1 to recover from being Stressed:

**Suggested Skills (Ob 1):**
- **Art**: Express yourself creatively to release tension
- **Athletics**: Work out physical stress through exercise
- **Carouse**: Blow off steam in social settings
- **Gambler**: Take your mind off problems with games
- **Medic**: Practice self-care and stress management
- **Steward**: Comfort yourself with good food and hospitality

The GM may allow other appropriate skills based on how the character chooses to relax and decompress.

If this test fails, the crewmember must wait for another GM Turn to attempt to recover from it again.

### Angry

Recovery obstacle 3. Often requires resolving the underlying cause of anger or receiving meaningful apology/justice.

### Tired

Recovery obstacle 2. Requires adequate rest or recuperation time. Can sometimes be resolved through simple downtime.

### Injured

Recovery obstacle 4. May require medical attention, proper supplies, or extended healing time depending on severity.

### Sick

Recovery obstacle 4-6 depending on severity. May require specific treatments, medicines, or quarantine periods.
