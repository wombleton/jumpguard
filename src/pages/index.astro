<Layout title="Jump Guard">
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>Jump Guard adapts the Mouse Guard RPG system for spacefaring adventures in the Mongoose Traveller universe. Players take on the roles of a starship crew navigating the dangers of space, trade, and interstellar politics.</p>
	
	<h3>How it's different to Mongoose Traveller</h3>
	<p>While Mongoose Traveller focuses on detailed simulation and skill-based resolution, Jump Guard emphasizes narrative drama and collaborative storytelling. The game uses a structured turn-based approach with Space Turns for missions and Ship Turns for character development and crew interactions.</p>
	
	<h3>Unplanned stories</h3>
	<p>Jump Guard thrives on emergent narrative. Rather than following predetermined plots, stories arise from character beliefs, failed dice rolls, and the consequences of player choices. The GM sets up situations, but the crew's decisions and dice results determine how events unfold.</p>
	
	<h3>Taking turns</h3>
	<p>Play alternates between Space Turns (mission-focused gameplay where the GM drives the action) and Ship Turns (crew-focused time where players pursue personal goals, recover from conditions, and develop relationships).</p>
	
	<h3>Dice rolls, successes and failures</h3>
	<p>Jump Guard uses d6 dice pools. Roll dice equal to your skill rating plus ability. Each die showing 4, 5, or 6 counts as a success. You need successes equal to the obstacle rating to succeed. Failure isn't just "nothing happens" - it drives the story forward through twists and conditions.</p>
	
	<h3>Roll annotations, margins of success & failure</h3>
	<p>Track not just success/failure, but by how much. Extra successes beyond the obstacle can provide additional benefits. Failing by large margins can result in more severe consequences or conditions.</p>
