# Space Turn

The Space Turn is the mission-focused phase of play where the crew faces external challenges and the GM drives the action forward.

## GM notes Beliefs, Instincts, Relationships

Before starting, review each character's Beliefs, Instincts, and relationships. Look for opportunities to challenge beliefs, trigger instincts, and involve important NPCs. These elements should inform the obstacles and complications you introduce during the Space Turn.

## The prologue

Begin each Space Turn with a brief scene-setting prologue. Describe the crew's current situation, location, and any immediate concerns. This frames the upcoming challenges and gives players context for their characters' mindset and readiness.

## The challenge before the crew

Present the crew with their primary mission or challenge. This could be delivering cargo through pirate space, investigating a derelict ship, negotiating a trade deal, or responding to a distress signal. The challenge should connect to the crew's ongoing story and character motivations.

## Write session goals

The GM should establish clear, measurable goals for the Space Turn. These aren't character goals but session objectives that define success or failure for the mission. Examples: "Deliver the cargo intact," "Discover what happened to the missing survey team," or "Negotiate safe passage through Zhodani space."

## GM notes goals

Consider how session goals interact with character goals and beliefs. Look for opportunities where personal objectives might conflict with mission success, creating dramatic tension and meaningful choices for the players.

## Notes on mission goals (adapt from Mouse Guard to more traveller-themed challenges)

Space Turn missions should feel authentically Traveller: trade disputes, first contact scenarios, salvage operations, passenger transport complications, or brushes with interstellar politics. Focus on the challenges of operating in the vast, dangerous frontier of space rather than woodland patrol duties.

## How the Space Turn plays

### Apply pressure

Continuously escalate tension through time pressure, resource constraints, or mounting complications. Each obstacle should make the situation more urgent or complex, forcing characters to make harder choices.

### Set obstacles

Design obstacles that require different skills and approaches. Mix social challenges, technical problems, combat encounters, and moral dilemmas. Each obstacle should have clear stakes and consequences for both success and failure.

### Success

When characters overcome obstacles, advance the mission and provide meaningful progress toward the session goals. Success should feel earned and create new opportunities or information.

### Failure

Failed rolls don't stop the story - they complicate it. Introduce twists, conditions, or new obstacles that push the narrative in unexpected directions while maintaining forward momentum.

### Move from obstacle to obstacle

Transition smoothly between challenges, using the results of previous obstacles to inform new complications. Build a chain of cause and effect that feels organic and interconnected.

### Players' role in Space Turn

Players focus on problem-solving, tactical thinking, and responding to challenges. They should feel reactive to GM-driven events while still having agency in how they approach problems.

### Ending the Space Turn

Conclude when the session goals are resolved (successfully or not) or when characters have accumulated enough conditions or consequences to warrant a Ship Turn for recovery and regrouping.
