# Conditions

Conditions represent temporary impairments that affect character performance and drive narrative consequences.

## Healthy

The default state. No penalties to tests or conflicts. Characters operate at full effectiveness.

## Stressed

Mental strain from pressure, fear, or overwhelming situations. 

> Any of the crew being Stressed subtracts 1 from all conflict disposition.

## Angry

Emotional volatility from frustration, betrayal, or injustice. 

> Any of the crew being Angry subtracts 1 from a conflict that uses Will as its base.

## Tired

Physical or mental exhaustion from overexertion or lack of rest.

> Any of the crew being Tired subtracts 1 from all conflict disposition.

## Injured

Physical harm from combat, accidents, or environmental dangers.

> Being Injured subtracts -1D from Will, Health, and skill tests. It does not affect Circles or condition recovery rolls.

## Sick

Illness, poisoning, or disease.

> Being Sick subtracts -1D from Will, Health, and skill tests. It does not affect Circles or condition recovery rolls.

## Rating zero

If your ability in any test is reduced to zero from being Injured or Sick, you cannot test it. You cannot benefit from teamwork or help.

## Multiple conditions

Conditions stack - each one imposes its penalty separately. Multiple conditions can quickly incapacitate a character.

## Conditions of failure

- Stressed can be the result of any test.
- Social tests can result in Angry.
- Athletic tests can result in Tired, or Injured.
- Work on ships can result in Angry, or Tired.
- Academic work can result in Tired.

## Conditions in conflicts

Roll disposition and then apply the penalties from conditions. Stressed, Angry, and Tired will do this. Apply the unique conditions in a team.

Injured & Sick affect almost all rolls from the crewmembers.

## Conditions as part of compromise

You can apply conditions as part of a compromise, or even multiple conditions for major compromises.

## Recovery

### Recovery order

Recovery tests must be made in specific order: Stressed first, then Angry, then Tired, then Injured, then Sick. You cannot recover from later conditions while earlier ones remain.

### Stressed

You just need a break! Test one of these skills at Obstacle 1 to recover from being Stressed:

**Suggested Skills (Ob 1):**
- **Art**: Express yourself creatively to release tension
- **Athletics**: Work out physical stress through exercise
- **Carouse**: Blow off steam in social settings
- **Gambler**: Take your mind off problems with games
- **Medic**: Practice self-care and stress management
- **Steward**: Comfort yourself with good food and hospitality

The GM may allow other appropriate skills based on how the character chooses to relax and decompress.

If this test fails, the crewmember must wait for another GM Turn to attempt to recover from it again.

### Angry

Recovering from Angry is an Ob 2 Will test. If you succeed the anger fades. If you fail it persists. You may test in Ship Turn, or spend checks to test in Space Turn. Describe what you do to attempt to resolve your angerâ€”meditated in the observation deck, worked out in the ship's gym, repaired equipment to focus your mind, or vented frustration in the ship's holodeck.

### Tired

Fatigue can be recovered from in four ways:

1. **Jumpspace Recovery**: The week-long lull of jumpspace travel automatically removes the Tired condition. The isolation from normal space-time provides perfect rest and restoration.

2. **Deep Relaxation**: Quality rest at a Traveller's Aid Society facility, luxury resort, or other deeply relaxing place automatically removes the Tired condition. This is not a night of sleep between watches.

3. **Steward Care**: Another crewmember can attempt an Ob 2 Steward test to provide proper care, nutrition, and comfort. Success removes the Tired condition.

4. **Push Through**: Make an Ob 3 Health test to overcome exhaustion through willpower alone. Success removes the condition. Failure means the Tired condition persists until you get proper rest or care.

### Injured

Physical trauma requires time and care to heal properly. You can attempt an Ob 4 Health test to overcome the pain and dysfunction through willpower alone. Success removes the condition. Failure means the injury persists until you receive proper medical attention.

Medical treatment requires an Ob 3 Medic test from another crew member or qualified healthcare provider. Success heals the injury and removes the condition. If the medical treatment fails, the injury heals improperly, causing permanent damage - reduce one ability or skill (except Resources and Circles) by one level as chosen by the GM. This reduction can be restored later through normal advancement.

Example: The engineer is injured during a reactor malfunction. The ship's medic attempts treatment with an Ob 3 Medic test but fails. The GM reduces the engineer's Health from 4 to 3, explaining "The burns have left you with reduced lung capacity." The injury condition ends, but the permanent reduction remains until advanced.

Alternatively, a player may choose to forgo medical treatment during Ship Turn. The character pushes through the injury but suffers the permanent ability reduction described above. This choice doesn't require a test or check expenditure.

In the field, sometimes there's no time to wait for proper medical care. It's often better to accept permanent damage rather than operate under the ongoing penalty to all abilities and skills.

### Sick

Recovery from illness requires an Ob 4 Will test to fight off the infection or toxins. Success eliminates the condition. Failure means the sickness persists until the character receives medical treatment.

Medical treatment requires an Ob 3 Medic test from another crew member or qualified healthcare provider. Success cures the illness and removes the condition. If the medical treatment fails, the illness causes permanent damage - reduce one ability or skill (except Resources and Circles) by one level as chosen by the GM. This reduction can be restored later through normal advancement.

Alternatively, a player may choose to forgo medical treatment during Ship Turn. The character recovers from the immediate symptoms but suffers the permanent ability reduction described above. This choice doesn't require a test or check expenditure.
