## Overview

Jump Guard adapts the Mouse Guard RPG system for spacefaring adventures in the Mongoose Traveller universe. Players take on the roles of a starship crew navigating the dangers of space, trade, and interstellar politics.

### How it's different to Mongoose Traveller

While Mongoose Traveller focuses on detailed simulation and skill-based resolution, Jump Guard emphasizes narrative drama and collaborative storytelling. The game uses a structured turn-based approach with Space Turns for missions and Ship Turns for character development and crew interactions.

### Base game

You'll need the Mouse Guard system to answer detailed questions on play.

### Unplanned stories

Jump Guard thrives on emergent narrative. The GM sets up situations, but the crew's decisions and dice results determine how events unfold. When the mission is over, whether it's a success or failure, we get to look back and see the story that we've created.

### Dice Rolls, Successes and Failures

Jump Guard uses pools of six-sided dice to resolve actions and conflicts. When your character attempts something challenging, you'll typically roll between three and six dice. The number of dice depends on your character's relevant skill, assistance from crewmates, equipment bonuses, and other situational factors.

#### Success Thresholds

Each die result of 4, 5, or 6 counts as a success. Results of 1, 2, or 3 are failures and don't contribute to your total. After rolling, count up your successes to determine the outcome.

**Example:** Rolling five dice and getting results of 1, 2, 2, 4, 5 gives you two successes (the 4 and 5).

#### Notation

**Successes (s):** When you see "2s" it means "two successes." This represents successful dice results or bonuses. "+1s" means you add one success to your total after rolling.

**Dice Modifiers:** "+1D" means add one die to your pool before rolling. "-1D" means remove one die from your pool before rolling.

#### Margins

**Margin of Success:** When you roll more successes than needed, the extra successes become your margin of success. If you needed 3 successes but rolled 5, your margin of success is 2.

**Margin of Failure:** When you don't roll enough successes, the difference between what you needed and what you rolled is your margin of failure. If you needed 4 successes but only rolled 2, your margin of failure is 2.
