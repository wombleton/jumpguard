# Space Turn

The Space Turn is the mission-focused phase of play where the crew faces external challenges and the GM drives the action forward.

## GM Notes: Character Elements

Before initiating the Space Turn, review each crew member's Beliefs, Instincts, and relationships. Identify opportunities to test their convictions, activate their trained responses, and bring significant contacts into play. These character elements should drive the obstacles and complications you weave into the mission.

## Mission Briefing

Open each Space Turn with a mission briefing that establishes the crew's current status, location, and immediate situation. Detail their ship's condition, available resources, and any pressing concerns. This contextualizes the upcoming challenges and helps players understand their operational parameters.

## Primary Mission Parameters

Present the crew with their core mission objective. This might involve:
- Cargo runs through contested space
- Derelict ship investigations
- Diplomatic negotiations with alien species
- Emergency response to distress beacons
- Salvage operations in hazardous systems
- Passenger transport through dangerous territory

The mission should tie into the crew's continuing narrative and individual character arcs.

## Mission Objectives

Establish clear, quantifiable objectives for the Space Turn. These operational goals define mission success or failure, separate from individual character goals. Examples:
- "Deliver the fusion components without contamination"
- "Determine the fate of the research vessel *Starbound*"
- "Secure transit rights through the Spinward Marches"
- "Extract the diplomatic envoy before the system falls"

## Objective Integration

Consider how mission objectives intersect with personal goals and beliefs. Engineer scenarios where individual priorities might conflict with operational success, generating dramatic tension and forcing difficult decisions that reveal character depth.

## Mission Design Philosophy

Space Turn missions should capture the essence of interstellar adventure: the vastness of space, the isolation of frontier worlds, and the complexity of operating across multiple star systems. Focus on challenges unique to spacefaring crews:
- Navigating bureaucratic red tape across different governments
- Dealing with environmental hazards of alien worlds
- Managing limited life support and fuel resources
- Balancing profit margins with crew safety
- Handling technology failures light-years from repair facilities

## How the Space Turn plays

During the Space Turn, the GM's role is to challenge the crew with meaningful obstacles that test their skills and resolve. The crew must prove their competence through adversity - without significant challenges, there's no opportunity for heroic moments or compelling drama. Engaging gameplay emerges from difficult decisions and hard-fought victories.

The GM initiates the Space Turn by establishing the operational environment and presenting the first obstacle. This initial challenge should directly threaten the crew's ability to complete their mission objectives, creating immediate tension and requiring tactical response.

### Overcoming Operational Hazards

Present obstacles clearly to the crew. Describe the challenge they face:

"The cargo manifest shows three possible destinations in this sector. Without knowing which station the smuggler chose, you could be searching for weeks."

"Solar flare activity has disrupted all navigation beacons in this system. Finding the research outpost will require manual stellar positioning."

"A massive derelict freighter has drifted into the station's docking ring. If it's not moved soon, it'll block all traffic and strand hundreds of passengers."

After establishing the situation, identify which skills or abilities the crew needs to overcome the obstacle:

"You'll need to use your Investigation skill to track the smuggler's likely destination."

"Reaching the research outpost requires an Astrogation test using stellar positioning."

"You'll need Engineering and Ship Systems knowledge to safely move that derelict."

Always provide alternative approaches to give players tactical options:

"You could also use your Trade connections or Criminal contacts to predict which station the smuggler would choose."

"You could attempt to use your Computer skill to slice into traffic control systems and remotely guide the derelict, but that would be extremely difficult and illegal."

### Operational Urgency

During the Space Turn, crews operate under constant pressure to complete their mission objectives. Time constraints, limited resources, and mounting complications leave no opportunity for extended rest or recovery. The crew must tackle each challenge as it arises, maintaining forward momentum toward their goals.

#### Limited Recovery Options

Crew members accumulate stress and damage during Space Turn operations. They may become Fatigued, Stressed, Injured, Sick, or suffer equipment malfunctions, though typically not all simultaneously. These conditions reflect the toll of operating under constant pressure in hazardous environments.

## Recovery Restrictions

Crew members cannot recover from operational conditions during the Space Turn, even with GM permission, unless they expend a special resource called checks. Checks are earned by using character traits in specific ways. The mechanics for earning and spending checks are detailed in the crew response guidelines.

### Mission Challenges

The GM introduces obstacles that block the crew's progress and determines the requirements to overcome them. These challenges range from simple problems requiring a single test to complex situations demanding multiple coordinated tests.

Challenges are resolved through skill tests - dice rolls where the character's ability rating determines the size of the dice pool. Each test produces either success or failure, driving the mission forward regardless of outcome.

#### Simple Challenges

The GM introduces straightforward obstacles from common spacefaring hazards—sensor interference, minor system malfunctions, bureaucratic delays, or hostile encounters. These require only a single test to resolve.

Environmental and technical problems make excellent simple challenges, though brief social encounters with station personnel or other crew members can also be resolved with single tests.

Locating a missing person in a familiar starport district is a simple challenge overcome using the Investigation skill.

#### Complex Challenges

Some obstacles require multiple coordinated efforts to overcome. The GM can call for several different skill tests to resolve a single major challenge.

To repair a damaged jump drive, the crew might need Engineering to diagnose the problem, Computer to reprogram the control systems, and Mechanics to physically replace damaged components.

Complex challenges work best for major technical projects, elaborate rescue operations, or multi-stage infiltration plans.

#### Extended Conflicts

Beyond complex challenges lies detailed conflict resolution. Some scenes demand extensive focus and granular action tracking—ship-to-ship combat, heated negotiations, or pursuit sequences through asteroid fields. These extended scenes zoom in on individual actions and their immediate consequences.

Boarding a hostile vessel might require overcoming security obstacles, navigating through defended corridors, and ultimately confronting the ship's captain in a climactic standoff.

Detailed conflict mechanics are covered in the Resolution chapter. The following sections address basic Success and Failure outcomes before moving to advanced topics.

### Success

When a player succeeds at a test, they achieve their intended goal and overcome the obstacle. Both GM and player should contribute vivid descriptions that highlight the character's competence and the successful outcome.

The pilot decides to navigate through the asteroid field using manual controls rather than the damaged autopilot. She passes her Pilot skill test and guides the ship safely through the debris field without hull damage.

After celebrating the success, advance to the next challenge. The GM describes the mission's progression and can either ask players for their next actions or narrate the crew's continued operations toward the next obstacle.

### Failure

When a player fails a test, the GM has two options: introduce a narrative twist that complicates the mission, or allow success with consequences that impose conditions on the character (such as Stressed, Injured, Exhausted, or similar states).

Failed navigation through the asteroid field doesn't mean the ship crashes. Instead, the failure might reveal that the "asteroids" are actually camouflaged pirate vessels, or the ship succeeds in transit but suffers minor hull breaches that will require repairs.

Twists can create entirely new obstacles or simply add dramatic moments that enrich the scene without requiring additional tests.

### Mission Progression

Regardless of test outcomes, the mission must advance. The GM introduces new challenges that build upon previous results, ensuring each obstacle feels distinct from the last.

Failed tests create narrative twists that spawn unforeseen complications. This drives dynamic storytelling where missions evolve beyond their original parameters. Twists can introduce new categories of challenges—technical failures, environmental hazards, hostile encounters, or bureaucratic entanglements. Alternatively, they can escalate existing problems to create cascading failures.

When the crew fails to locate the missing cargo ship on sensors, the mission doesn't stall. Instead, the failure reveals a new complication—debris patterns suggesting the vessel was destroyed. Once the crew investigates the wreckage, they discover the cargo ship's black box in a nearby asteroid field.

This twist fundamentally changes the mission scope. Rather than a simple rescue operation, the crew now faces a criminal investigation. They must trace the cargo ship's final transmissions and investigate potential sabotage at the origin station.

### Crew Response During Space Turn

During the Space Turn, players must tackle the operational challenges presented by the GM. Describe your character's reactions and proposed solutions to obstacles in vivid detail.

"I access the sensor array to scan for debris in our flight path."

The GM will identify specific tests needed to overcome obstacles, but players can suggest alternative approaches or different skill applications to handle the situation.

Players coordinate through both out-of-character discussion and in-character crew communication:

"Our fuel reserves are running low. Chief, can you optimize the reactor output to extend our range?"

When proposing solutions, describe what your character wants to attempt and which skill or ability applies. The GM evaluates the approach and either sets an obstacle rating for the test or suggests waiting for a more appropriate phase of play - such as extended conflicts that belong in dedicated scenes.

Effective crews collaborate and share tactical insights about optimal solutions. Players should actively seek opportunities to invoke their character traits during these challenges.

### Traits in the Space Turn

Players can invoke their character traits during the Space Turn to either help or hinder their actions. Using a trait beneficially provides bonus dice or rerolls for relevant tests.

The engineer has the Protective trait. When hull breaches threaten the crew, the player declares: "My character's protective instincts kick in - I'm using my Protective trait to get everyone to the emergency bulkheads!"

Conversely, using traits in self-defeating ways earns valuable checks that can be spent during the Ship Turn. This represents short-term sacrifice for long-term benefit.

The pilot has the Reckless trait. During a tense docking procedure, the player says: "I'm going to use my Reckless trait against myself - I'm pushing the engines too hard because I want to impress the station controller, even though it's dangerous."

Checks are essential resources for character advancement. Players should actively look for opportunities to earn them by having their traits create complications. Success comes from balancing immediate tactical needs with longer-term character development.

### Crew Conflicts During Operations

When crew members disagree on operational procedures during the Space Turn, resolve these disputes with opposed tests. Use Social skills for debates, Leadership versus Will for command decisions, or even Combat skills if tensions escalate to physical confrontation. These represent quick interpersonal obstacles, not extended conflicts.

The pilot and navigator disagree about which jump route to take through the asteroid field. This dispute is resolved with the navigator's Astrogation skill opposed by the pilot's Pilot skill, each arguing their expertise.

Handle other crew tensions similarly with appropriate opposed tests. Characters can still use traits to assist or complicate these rolls, and failures can still result in twists or conditions that affect the mission.

### Mission Conclusion

End the Space Turn when mission objectives reach resolution or when accumulated stress, damage, or complications require a Ship Turn for maintenance, recovery, and crew development. Mission outcomes—whether successful, failed, or partially completed—should lead naturally into character-focused downtime.
