# Abilities and Skills

## Advancement

### No converting tests

You cannot simply convert successful tests into skill advancement. Tests must be earned through meaningful challenges and character development.

### Clean the slate

At the start of each session, mark any tests you've earned from the previous session's goals, beliefs, and conflicts.

### Conflicts earn one test

Participating in a full conflict (regardless of outcome) earns you one test toward a skill used in that conflict.

### Disposition roll

The final disposition roll in a conflict counts as a test for advancement if you participated meaningfully.

### Ties and advancement

Tied conflicts still count for advancement - the struggle itself teaches you something.

### Obstacle 0 tests

Trivial tests (obstacle 0) don't count for advancement. There must be real risk of failure for learning to occur.

## Learning a new skill

To learn a completely new skill, you must find a teacher, training materials, or gain practical experience. This typically requires spending Persona points and narrative justification.

## Will

Will represents mental fortitude, determination, and force of personality.

### Will obstacles

Will tests cover:
- Resisting fear, intimidation, or mental influence
- Maintaining composure under pressure
- Leading others in crisis situations
- Persevering through hardship or despair
- Social situations requiring force of personality

Will is also used to determine starting disposition in social conflicts and contributes to recovery from mental conditions like Stressed or Angry.

## Health

Health represents physical fitness, constitution, and bodily resilience.

### Health obstacles

Health tests cover:
- Resisting disease, poison, or environmental hazards
- Enduring physical hardship or exertion
- Recovering from injuries or conditions
- Surviving in hostile environments
- Maintaining peak physical performance

Health is used to determine starting disposition in physical conflicts and affects recovery speed from physical conditions like Injured, Sick, or Tired.

## Circles

Circles represents your network of contacts, allies, and connections across known space.

### Home planet advantage

When operating on your home planet or in familiar territory, gain +1 die to Circles tests due to established relationships and local knowledge.

### Circles factors

Circles difficulty varies by location:
- **Home system**: Obstacle 2-3
- **Familiar regions**: Obstacle 3-4  
- **Neutral space**: Obstacle 4-5
- **Hostile territory**: Obstacle 5-6
- **Unexplored regions**: Obstacle 6+

### Circles success

Successful Circles tests introduce helpful NPCs, provide information, or grant access to resources. The margin of success determines how useful or well-disposed the contact is.

### Circles twist -- the enmity clause

Failed Circles tests don't just mean no help - they can introduce enemies, rivals, or complications from your past. That contact you were hoping to find might hold a grudge.

### Enemies to friends, friends to enemies

Relationships evolve through play. Allies can become rivals through your actions, and enemies might become valuable contacts if you find common ground.
