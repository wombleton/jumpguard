# The Ship Crew

Character creation and management in Jump Guard.

## How to migrate a Mongoose Traveller character

Take your existing Mongoose Traveller character's skills and convert them to the Jump Guard system. Skills translate roughly 1:1, but you'll need to add the Jump Guard-specific elements: Beliefs, Goals, and Instincts. Consider your character's background and career to inform these narrative elements.

## Beliefs

Beliefs are fundamental convictions that drive your character's actions. They should be specific, actionable statements about how the universe works or what your character values. Examples: "Corporate executives can't be trusted," "Every sentient being deserves freedom," or "The crew comes before the mission." When you act on a belief or it complicates your life, you earn advancement.

## Goals

Goals are specific, achievable objectives your character wants to accomplish during the current adventure or story arc. They should be concrete and measurable. Examples: "Find evidence of illegal weapons dealing on Regina," "Convince the captain to take the high-paying but dangerous job," or "Repair my relationship with my estranged sister." Completing goals earns rewards.

## Instincts

Instincts are automatic reactions written as "If X, then Y" statements. They represent ingrained habits and reflexes. Examples: "If combat starts, I immediately seek cover," "If someone threatens the ship, I draw my weapon," or "If we're breaking atmo, I double-check the life support systems." Good instincts can save your life but might also get you in trouble.

## Fate points

Fate represents your character's ability to influence dramatic moments and survive dangerous situations. Spend Fate points to add extra dice to important rolls, avoid death, or make narrative declarations. You earn Fate by having your Beliefs complicate your life or by exceptional roleplay.

## Persona points

Persona points are more powerful than Fate and represent your character's growth and legend. Spend them to permanently improve abilities, learn new skills, or make major narrative changes. Persona is earned through completing significant story milestones and achieving character goals.
