# Traits

## Using Traits to Help Yourself

To benefit from a character trait, you must integrate it into your description of the character's actions. Explain what your character is doing and how the trait provides an advantage in the current situation.

Traits are ranked from 1 to 3, representing their potency and availability.

> You may only use one trait to help yourself per test.

### Level 1 Trait

A level 1 trait provides a +1D bonus to appropriate tests. Before rolling, the player must describe how the trait influences and benefits their character's action. If the group agrees the description is compelling and the trait applies, add the bonus die to the roll.

"My character's Methodical trait helps me systematically check each connection in the damaged life support system."

If the GM and other players approve this description, gain +1D to the Engineering test.

Level 1 traits may be used once per session unless recharged.

Since this Methodical trait is Level 1, it can only provide this bonus once per session.

### Level 2 Trait

A level 2 trait provides +1D to all applicable tests without usage limits. The player must still describe how the trait influences their character's actions, and the group must agree the trait applies.

If the Methodical trait were Level 2, it could add a bonus die to any relevant test throughout the session, as long as the player describes methodical actions and the group agrees.

### Level 3 Trait

Level 3 traits allow rerolling failed dice on appropriate tests. Regardless of the initial test outcome, pick up all failed dice and reroll them. Add any new successes to the original total. Fate points must be spent after the reroll.

Level 3 traits may be used once per session unless recharged.

Testing Engineering 5 against a difficulty of 7, rolling three successes and two failures. Using a level 3 Focused trait, reroll the two failures to potentially gain additional successes.

When combining fate points with level 3 traits, use the trait reroll first, then spend fate points on any sixes from the complete result.

# Using Traits Against Yourself

Traits can also create complications that interfere with your character's actions. A Compassionate crew member might hesitate before abandoning civilians, or a Methodical engineer might waste precious time double-checking systems during an emergency.

Using traits against yourself follows the same descriptive process as beneficial usage. Describe your character's actions and explain how the trait creates problems or limitations.

A Protective trait might cause reckless behavior when crew members are threatened. An Analytical nature could lead to overthinking in time-critical situations. A Cautious disposition might prevent taking necessary risks.

If the group agrees the trait application makes sense, choose an effect from the negative trait options below.

**Usage Limits:**
- Only one trait may hinder you per test
- You may help and hinder yourself on the same roll using different traits
- The same trait cannot both help and hinder you simultaneously

The navigator can use their Methodical trait to gain bonus dice for astrogation calculations, while their Perfectionist trait penalizes the same roll due to excessive double-checking.

The navigator cannot use their Methodical trait to both help and hinder the same test.

## Trait Complications

You can invoke traits to create three types of complications:

**Impede yourself:** Reduce your own dice pool on any test
**Disadvantage yourself:** Give opponents bonus dice on opposed tests  
**Concede advantage:** Break tied opposed tests in your opponent's favor

Each complication earns trait checks - resources you can spend during Ship Turn for character advancement and special actions.

**Timing and Limits:**
- Choose only one complication effect per test
- Declare impediments and disadvantages before rolling
- Tie-breaking can be declared after seeing tied results
- All trait complications require group consensus, just like beneficial trait usage

#### Impede: Earns 1 Check

You may invoke a trait to hinder your own actions. Subtract -1D from your current roll. This applies to both independent tests and opposed tests. Impeding yourself earns one check.

The pilot's player says, "My character's Perfectionist trait makes me double-check the navigation calculations even though we're running out of time. I'm taking a -1D penalty to my Pilot test because I can't help but verify every calculation twice."
#### Hurt: Earns 2 Checks

You may invoke a trait to give your opponent a significant advantage. Add +2D to their current roll. This effect only applies to opposed tests. Hurting yourself in a test earns two checks.

The engineer has the Chronic Pain trait. During a zero-g EVA repair mission, the player says, "My character's old injury flares up in the cold vacuum, causing me to lose grip on the hull plating. I'm giving the malfunctioning airlock system +2D to resist my repair attempt."

The GM adds those two dice to the system's difficulty rating when rolling to determine if the repair succeeds.
#### Concede Advantage: Earns 2 Checks

You may concede a tied opposed test to your opponent. They succeed while you fail. This effect only applies to opposed tests and earns two checks.

**Important timing:** You must invoke your trait before spending fate points or calling for tiebreaker rolls.

**Margin calculation:** When used to break ties in tests that generate margin of success, the opponent's margin is always 1.

The security chief and engineer are competing to access the ship's emergency protocols during a crisis. Both roll equal successes on their Computer tests. The security chief's player says, "My character's Selfless trait makes me realize the engineer needs this access more than I do right now - the ship's life support is failing. I use my trait to concede the tie, stepping back from the console."

## Spending Trait Checks

Trait checks are earned through using traits and can be spent for various benefits.

### Tests in Ship Turn: 1 Check

During Ship Turn, spend 1 trait check to make an additional test for personal projects, recovery, or skill development.

### Recover quickly: 2 Checks

Spend 2 trait checks to immediately attempt recovery from a condition without waiting for appropriate circumstances or time.

### Charge a trait: 3 Checks

Spend 3 checks to temporarily increase a trait's level by 1 for a single scene or conflict. This represents pushing yourself beyond normal limits.

### Recharge a trait: 2 or 4 Checks

If a trait has been "used up" or exhausted in play, spend 2 checks to restore a Level 1 trait, or 4 checks to restore a Level 2+ trait to full effectiveness.

## Sample Traits

#### Adaptable
You quickly adjust to new situations and find creative solutions when plans fail. This flexibility helps you thrive in unpredictable environments. However, your adaptability can make you seem unreliable and cause you to abandon working strategies too quickly.

#### Ambitious
You're driven to achieve greatness and advance your position. This hunger for success motivates you to excel under pressure. However, your ambition can blind you to crew needs and lead you to prioritize personal advancement over mission objectives.

#### Analytical
You approach problems systematically, breaking them down into logical components. This helps you solve complex challenges and spot patterns others miss. However, your need to analyze every detail can slow you down and cause overthinking in simple situations.

#### Cautious
You carefully assess risks before taking action, considering potential dangers. This prudent approach helps you avoid traps and spot hazards. However, your caution can prevent you from seizing opportunities or taking necessary risks when bold action is required.

#### Compassionate
You genuinely care about others' wellbeing and can understand their perspectives. This empathy helps you negotiate peaceful solutions and earn trust. However, your compassion may prevent you from making hard tactical decisions when sacrifice is necessary.

You view situations as contests to be won and hate being outperformed. This drive pushes you to excel and overcome challenges. However, your need to win can turn allies into rivals and cause unnecessary risks to prove superiority.

#### Curious
You're driven to explore, learn, and understand how things work. This helps you uncover hidden information and adapt to new situations. However, your curiosity can lead you to investigate dangers without preparation or ignore priorities for mysteries.

You form deep bonds with your crew and stand by them through hardship. This inspires trust and creates team cohesion. However, your devotion can cloud judgment about their mistakes and prevent objective decisions that might harm them.

#### Prideful
You take great satisfaction in your accomplishments and expect recognition. This helps you maintain confidence under pressure and stand up for principles. However, your pride can prevent admitting mistakes or accepting help when needed.

#### Stoic
You maintain emotional control and accept hardship without complaint. This helps you endure extreme stress and make rational decisions when others are overwhelmed. However, your stoicism can make you seem cold and prevent forming deep connections.

#### Suspicious
You're always alert for deception, hidden motives, and potential betrayal. This helps you spot lies and avoid traps that fool trusting individuals. However, your suspicion can prevent necessary alliances and lead you to see conspiracies where none exist.
