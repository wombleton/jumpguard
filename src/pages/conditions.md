# Conditions

Conditions represent temporary impairments that affect character performance and drive narrative consequences.

## Healthy

The default state. No penalties to tests or conflicts. Characters operate at full effectiveness.

## Stressed

Mental strain from pressure, fear, or overwhelming situations. -1 die penalty to all tests until recovered.

## Angry

Emotional volatility from frustration, betrayal, or injustice. -1 die penalty to all tests, but +1 die to actions driven by anger.

## Tired

Physical or mental exhaustion from overexertion or lack of rest. -1 die penalty to all tests until proper rest is obtained.

## Injured

Physical harm from combat, accidents, or environmental dangers. -1 die penalty to all tests, may worsen if not treated.

## Sick

Illness, poisoning, or disease. -1 die penalty to all tests, may spread to others or worsen over time.

## Rating zero

When any ability drops to zero, the character is incapacitated in that area. Zero Will means breakdown, zero Health means unconscious.

## Multiple conditions

Conditions stack - each one imposes its penalty separately. Multiple conditions can quickly incapacitate a character.

## Conditions of failure

Failed tests often result in conditions rather than simple failure. This keeps the story moving while imposing meaningful consequences.

## Conditions in conflicts

Conditions apply their penalties during conflicts and may worsen based on conflict results. Severe injuries in fights can impose multiple conditions.

## Conditions as part of compromise

Characters might accept conditions as part of a conflict compromise, trading immediate harm for achieving partial goals.

## Recovery

### Recovery order

Recovery tests must be made in specific order: Angry and Stressed first, then Tired, then Injured, then Sick. You cannot recover from later conditions while earlier ones remain.

### Stressed

Recovery obstacle 3. Success removes the condition. Failure means it persists and you cannot attempt recovery again until circumstances change.

### Angry

Recovery obstacle 3. Often requires resolving the underlying cause of anger or receiving meaningful apology/justice.

### Tired

Recovery obstacle 2. Requires adequate rest or recuperation time. Can sometimes be resolved through simple downtime.

### Injured

Recovery obstacle 4. May require medical attention, proper supplies, or extended healing time depending on severity.

### Sick

Recovery obstacle 4-6 depending on severity. May require specific treatments, medicines, or quarantine periods.
