## Participants

Identify all active participants and which side they support. Each side combines their efforts and shares disposition.

## Teamwork in conflicts

Team members can coordinate actions, with the team leader typically making key decisions about tactics and target selection.

## Conflict goals

Each side must have a clear, achievable goal that defines what victory means. Goals should be mutually exclusive or create meaningful opposition.

## Starting disposition

Each side begins with disposition equal to their Will + relevant skill. This represents their ability to continue fighting for their goal.

## Modifiers to disposition

Circumstances, preparation, equipment, or environmental factors can modify starting disposition up or down by 1-3 points.

## Actions

### Attack

Direct action against opponents. Most aggressive but risky approach.

### Defend

Protect yourself while maintaining position. Reduces incoming damage but limits offensive capability.

### Feint

Misdirection to set up future attacks. Creates advantages for subsequent actions.

### Maneuver

Reposition for tactical advantage or change the conflict dynamic. Can alter the battlefield or create new opportunities.

## Action table

Cross-reference your action against your opponent's to determine the result. Different combinations provide various advantages and disadvantages in resolution.

## What skill do I use?

Choose skills appropriate to your declared action and the conflict type. The same conflict might allow multiple skill approaches.

## Multiple characters in a team

Team members can take different actions that complement each other. Coordinate for maximum effectiveness.

## Winning a conflict

Victory goes to the side that reduces their opponents' disposition to zero while maintaining positive disposition themselves.

## Losing a conflict

Defeat means failing to achieve your conflict goal and potentially suffering additional consequences based on how badly you lost.

## Tying a conflict

If all sides reach zero disposition simultaneously, the result is a draw with partial success for everyone or a pyrrhic victory.

## Compromise

At any point, sides can negotiate a compromise that gives everyone something but not everything they wanted.

## Binding results

Conflict results are final and meaningful. Winners achieve their stated goals, and losers must accept the consequences.

## Pass and fail in conflicts

Individual actions within conflicts can succeed or fail, affecting disposition damage and tactical position.

## Gear for conflicts

### Weapons, ranges and suchlike. Will need a lot of translation for Traveller.

Firearms provide significant advantages in fight conflicts. Range categories (Close, Short, Medium, Long, Extreme) affect accuracy and damage potential.

### Armour, again, a lot of translation needed

Personal armor reduces incoming disposition damage in fight conflicts. Different armor types protect against different threats.

### Weapons of Wit

In social conflicts, reputation, information, and social connections serve as "weapons" that increase your effectiveness.

### Chase

Vehicles, enhanced movement capabilities, or knowledge of terrain provide advantages in chase conflicts.
