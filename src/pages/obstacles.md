# Obstacles

How obstacles work in Jump Guard.

## Setting obstacles

Obstacles represent challenges that require dice rolls to overcome. Set obstacle ratings from 1 (trivial) to 8 (legendary). Consider the character's skill level, the stakes involved, and the dramatic needs of the story when setting difficulty.

## Tests

Core testing mechanics.

### No shortcuts

When facing an obstacle, characters must use the appropriate skill and approach. You can't bypass a technical challenge with pure charisma, or solve a diplomatic crisis with gunfire (usually). The fiction must support your approach.

### Who makes the test

Usually the character taking the action makes the test, but sometimes circumstances or teamwork might change this. The GM decides who rolls based on who's primarily responsible for the outcome.

### Describe your action

Players must describe specifically what their character is doing before rolling dice. The description informs which skill to use and may affect the difficulty or consequences of the test.

### Independent tests

Most tests are independent - you're trying to meet or exceed a target number set by the GM. Roll your dice pool and count successes.

### Versus tests

When characters oppose each other directly, both roll dice and compare successes. The higher total wins. These are common in social conflicts or competitions.

### Making ties

When an independent test exactly meets the obstacle rating, it's a success but with a complication or cost. In versus tests, ties usually favor the defender or status quo.

### Breaking ties

For versus tests, if both sides have the same number of successes, the character with the higher skill rating wins. If skills are equal, roll additional dice to break the tie.

### Passed tests

Success means you achieve your stated goal and advance the story. The degree of success (how many successes over the obstacle) might determine additional benefits or how completely you succeed.

### Failed tests

What happens when tests fail.

#### Twists

Failed tests can introduce unexpected complications that change the situation. The goal might become harder to achieve, new problems might arise, or the stakes might increase.

#### Conditions

Failure might impose conditions like Stressed, Tired, or Injured on characters, representing the toll of attempting difficult or dangerous actions.

### "I'm going to have to science this"

When characters attempt something beyond their current skill level, they can push themselves by accepting additional risk or consequences for a chance at success.

### Gear

Appropriate equipment can add dice to your pool or reduce obstacle difficulty. Improvised or poor equipment might penalize rolls. Gear should feel significant but not overshadow character skill.

### Teamwork

Working together on tests.

#### How can I help?

Other characters can assist by lending their skill dice to the primary actor's roll. The helper must have relevant skills and a credible way to contribute.

#### You reap what you sow

When you help another character, you share in both the benefits of success and the consequences of failure. Choose your assistance carefully.

### Recovery help

Other characters can assist with tests to recover from conditions, representing medical aid, emotional support, or practical assistance.

### Beginner's luck

When a character attempts a test using a skill they don't possess, they rely on raw ability and intuition. If a character does not have an appropriate skill for a test, they may roll their Will or Health instead. Total up the dice for the ability, wises, help and gear. Make the test using half that number, rounded up. If the skill is physical, use half of Health. If the skill is mental or social-oriented, use half of Will.

Easy tasks won't be too much of a problem, but more complex operations will be significantly harder.

*Example: The engineer doesn't have the Pilot skill but needs to dock the ship in an emergency. She rolls half her Will, rounded up, versus the docking obstacle.*

#### Spending Persona Points on Unskilled Tests
Persona points are added after the number of dice is halved.

If an ability is at zero due to Injury or Sickness, you cannot test it using Beginner's Luck at this time. You must wait until you've recovered.

Using Beginner's Luck is the first step in learning a new skill. See the Learning New Skills heading in the Abilities and Skills chapter for the complete process.

## Factoring Obstacles

### Range of difficulty

Obstacles range from 1 (trivial) to 8 (legendary):
- **1-2**: Simple tasks that might still fail under pressure
- **3-4**: Moderate challenges requiring competence
- **5-6**: Difficult tasks requiring expertise
- **7-8**: Legendary challenges that define careers

### Skill factors

Your skill level relative to the obstacle affects your chances:
- Skill much higher than obstacle: Very likely success
- Skill equal to obstacle: Moderate chance
- Skill lower than obstacle: Difficult but possible

### Traveller version of time, weather, night factors

Environmental and situational factors modify obstacles:
- **Time pressure**: +1-2 to obstacle (rushing repairs, combat deadlines)
- **Environmental hazards**: +1-3 to obstacle (vacuum, radiation, extreme temperatures)
- **Poor conditions**: +1-2 to obstacle (low light, ship damage, equipment failure)
- **Advantageous conditions**: -1-2 to obstacle (ideal tools, ample time, expert assistance)

### Winging it

When attempting tasks without proper preparation, equipment, or knowledge:
- Increase obstacle by +1-3
- Success might be temporary or incomplete
- Failure consequences are often more severe
- Consider requiring multiple tests for complex tasks
