# The Ship Crew

Character creation and management in Jump Guard.

## How to migrate a Mongoose Traveller character

Take your existing Mongoose Traveller character's skills and convert them to the Jump Guard system. Skills translate roughly 1:1, but you'll need to add the Jump Guard-specific elements: Beliefs, Goals, and Instincts. Consider your character's background and career to inform these narrative elements.

## Beliefs

Beliefs are fundamental convictions that drive your character's actions. They should be specific, actionable statements about how the universe works or what your character values. Examples: "Corporate executives can't be trusted," "Every sentient being deserves freedom," or "The crew comes before the mission." When you act on a belief or it complicates your life, you earn advancement.

## Goals

Goals are specific, achievable objectives your character wants to accomplish during the current Space Turn. They should be concrete and measurable. Examples: "Find evidence of illegal weapons dealing on Regina," "Convince the captain to take the high-paying but dangerous job," or "Repair my relationship with my estranged sister." Completing goals earns rewards.

## Instincts

Instincts are automatic reactions written as "If X, then Y" statements. They represent ingrained habits and reflexes. Examples: "If combat starts, I immediately seek cover," "If someone threatens the ship, I draw my weapon," or "If we're breaking atmo, I double-check the life support systems." Good instincts can save your life but might also get you in trouble.

## Earning rewards
You earn rewards for the way you play your character. Rewards are accrued in points. These points are used to modify dice rolls. There are two types of points: fate points and persona points.

## Fate points

Fate points represent luck and good fortune
smiling down on your character.
Fate points are spent after a roll in which
some of your dice came up 6s. If you
choose to spend a fate point, count the number
of 6s you rolled. Pick up one new die for each 6.
Roll those dice and add any successes to the
total from the first roll. If you roll more 6s in the
second roll, keep going! Pick up another die for
each new 6 and roll again. Keep rolling new dice
until you don’t roll any more 6s. Count up all the
successes you rolled.

There are three ways to earn fate points.
You may earn up to three fate points in
one session.
Acting on Your Belief
If your character’s actions in the game reflect
his Belief, you earn one fate point. You may get
this award once per session.
When Sadie finds Conrad, she feeds him. She
feels compassion for him. She acts with her
heart. When she’s forced to choose between
Conrad and the mission, she thinks with her
head and leaves Conrad behind while she
completes the mission.
This dramatic play earns
her player a fate point at
the end of the session.
Working Toward a Goal
If your characters’ actions
worked toward your Goal,
but did not accomplish it,
you earn one fate point.
You may get this award
once per session.
Playing an Instinct
If you have your character
p e r fo r m t h e a c t i o n
described in the Instinct at
the proper time during the
game, you earn one fate
point. You may get this
award once per session.

## Persona points

Persona points represent a special reserve of inner strength that your character has built up over the course of his career.  Persona points are spent before you roll. Each point spent can add +1D to your roll. Add the bonus dice to your total before you roll and then roll like normal. You may spend up to three persona points to add bonus dice at once.

There are five ways to earn persona points. You may earn up to four persona points in one session.

### Accomplishing a Goal
If you accomplished your Goal during the session, you earn a persona point.

### Playing Against a Belief
This is a difficult one. It’s hard to quantify, but if you play against your Belief in a cool and dramatic fashion—if you make a decision in the game that’s counter to what you believe— and you let everyone know about it through your performance of your character, you earn a persona point.

### MVP
MVP stands for “most valuable player.” The MVP award goes to the player who made the crucial roll so that the crew could complete its mission. The group as a whole decides who gets the persona point for being the MVP. Only one player per session can be the MVP.

### Workhorse

Sometimes, one player carries the group through a lot of tough stuff. His character has all the right skills, and he makes all the rolls to keep things moving. The workhorse award is for him. Award him a persona point.

The group decides who is the workhorse for the session. You can’t be both MVP and workhorse. Only one player per session can be the workhorse.

### Embodiment
If you roleplay in a believable and entertaining manner throughout the entire session—if you use an accent, describe all your actions in vivid detail or bring your Belief, Goal and Instinct into play in a cool way—you earn a persona point.

The group decides who’s worthy of this reward. It can be awarded to more than one player, but it cannot be awarded to everyone.  If no one really captured their character during this session, this award does not have to be given out.
