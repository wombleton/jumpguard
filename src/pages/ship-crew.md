# The Ship Crew

Character creation and management in Jump Guard.

## How to migrate a Mongoose Traveller character

Take your existing Mongoose Traveller character's skills and convert them to the Jump Guard system. Skills translate roughly 1:1, but you'll need to add the Jump Guard-specific elements: Beliefs, Goals, and Instincts. Consider your character's background and career to inform these narrative elements.

## Beliefs

Beliefs are fundamental convictions that drive your character's actions. They should be specific, actionable statements about how the universe works or what your character values. Examples: "Corporate executives can't be trusted," "Every sentient being deserves freedom," or "The crew comes before the mission." When you act on a belief or it complicates your life, you earn advancement.

## Goals

Goals are specific, achievable objectives your character wants to accomplish during the current Space Turn. They should be concrete and measurable. Examples: "Find evidence of illegal weapons dealing on Regina," "Convince the captain to take the high-paying but dangerous job," or "Repair my relationship with my estranged sister." Completing goals earns rewards.

## Instincts

Instincts are automatic reactions written as "If X, then Y" statements. They represent ingrained habits and reflexes. Examples: "If combat starts, I immediately seek cover," "If someone threatens the ship, I draw my weapon," or "If we're breaking atmo, I double-check the life support systems." Good instincts can save your life but might also get you in trouble.

## Earning rewards
You earn rewards for the way you play your character. Rewards are accrued in points. These points are used to modify dice rolls. There are two types of points: fate points and persona points.

## Fate Points

Fate points represent those moments when the quantum odds align in your favor, when stellar navigation calculations work out perfectly, or when life support systems hold together just long enough. Fate points are spent after a roll in which some of your dice came up 6s. If you choose to spend a fate point, count the number of 6s you rolled. Pick up one new die for each 6. Roll those dice and add any successes to the total from the first roll. If you roll more 6s in the second roll, keep going! Pick up another die for each new 6 and roll again. Keep rolling new dice until you don't roll any more 6s. Count up all the successes you rolled.

There are three ways to earn fate points. You may earn up to three fate points in one session.

### Acting on Your Belief

If your character's actions in the game reflect their Belief, you earn one fate point. You may get this award once per session.

When a character is forced to choose between personal compassion and mission objectives, acting with their heart first but ultimately making the hard choice to complete the mission creates dramatic tension that earns a fate point at the end of the session.

### Working Toward a Goal

If your character's actions worked toward your Goal, but did not accomplish it, you earn one fate point. You may get this award once per session.

### Playing an Instinct

If you have your character perform the action described in the Instinct at the proper time during the game, you earn one fate point. You may get this award once per session.

## Persona Points

Persona points represent the inner strength and experience your character has developed throughout their career in space. These points are spent before making a roll to improve your chances of success. Each persona point spent adds +1D to your dice pool. You can spend up to three persona points on a single roll.

There are several ways to earn persona points during play. You may earn up to four persona points per session.

### Goal Achievement

When you successfully accomplish your character's Goal during a session, you earn one persona point. This rewards focused play and narrative progress.

### Dramatic Contradiction

When you have your character act directly against one of their core Beliefs in a dramatically significant moment, you earn a persona point. This represents the internal growth that comes from challenging your character's worldview.

### Mission Critical

The group collectively decides which player made the most crucial contribution to the mission's success. This player earns one persona point as recognition for their key role. Only one player per session can receive this award.

### Reliable Performer

Sometimes one player consistently steps up when the crew needs specific skills or expertise. The group can award a persona point to the player whose character served as the backbone of the mission. This award cannot be combined with Mission Critical, and only one player per session can receive it.

### Character Immersion

Players who demonstrate exceptional roleplay throughout the session - whether through consistent character voices, vivid action descriptions, or compelling integration of their Belief, Goal, and Instinct - may earn a persona point. The group decides who merits this recognition. Multiple players can receive this award, but it's not mandatory if no one stood out during the session.
