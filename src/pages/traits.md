# Traits

Traits are character quirks, advantages, and distinctive features that can help or hinder in specific situations.

## Helping yourself with traits

When a trait would logically assist with a test, you can invoke it to gain extra dice. The GM determines when traits apply and how many dice they provide.

## Level 1 Traits

Minor traits that provide +1 die when relevant. Examples: "Quick Reflexes," "Good with Numbers," "Charming Smile," "Suspicious Nature."

## Level 2 Traits

Significant traits that provide +2 dice when relevant. Examples: "Combat Veteran," "Noble Bearing," "Technical Genius," "Street Smart."

## Level 3 Traits

Major traits that provide +3 dice when relevant. Examples: "Legendary Pilot," "Master Negotiator," "Cybernetic Enhancement," "Psychic Sensitivity."

## Using traits against yourself

Players can choose to let negative aspects of their traits complicate situations in exchange for advancement opportunities. A "Suspicious Nature" might prevent trusting valuable allies, or "Combat Veteran" might cause flashbacks at inappropriate times.

## Spending Trait Checks

Trait checks are earned through using traits and can be spent for various benefits.

### Tests in Ship Turn: 1 Check

During Ship Turn, spend 1 trait check to make an additional test for personal projects, recovery, or skill development.

### Recover quickly: 2 Checks

Spend 2 trait checks to immediately attempt recovery from a condition without waiting for appropriate circumstances or time.

### Charge a trait: 3 Checks

Spend 3 checks to temporarily increase a trait's level by 1 for a single scene or conflict. This represents pushing yourself beyond normal limits.

### Recharge a trait: 2 or 4 Checks

If a trait has been "used up" or exhausted in play, spend 2 checks to restore a Level 1 trait, or 4 checks to restore a Level 2+ trait to full effectiveness.
